# About Countries

**About Countries** is a web application created to provide an interactive visualization of country data, inspired by the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com). The application aims to make country-specific information accessible and visually appealing, allowing users to explore, compare, and analyze various country metrics with ease.

## Overview

This project serves as a technical showcase, highlighting skills in frontend development, particularly in API integration, state management, and component-based UI design. **About Countries** demonstrates an efficient and user-friendly approach to data visualization by leveraging popular technologies and best practices. This project is intended as a demonstration and will not be actively maintained.

## Key Technologies & Tools

- **Framework:** Angular, for the application’s core structure and component-based architecture.
- **State Management:** NgRx, enabling smooth data flow and efficient state handling.
- **UI Components:** PrimeNG, providing consistent and responsive UI elements to create a modern look and feel.
